# scalping_bot
A small scalping bot for the IG platform using Selenium

I developed this for automated trading on the IG platform - unfinished due to technical issues, but managed to work for a little while on an IG demo account.

It works by scraping data from trading sites, and using that to guide small trades (scalping).
